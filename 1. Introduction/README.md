<h2> Notes for this lesson : </h2>

+ Deep learning involves training neural networks.
+ ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function functions are used in neurons.
+ Standard Neural Networks are used in applications such as determining real estate prices, classifying if the user will click on an ad, etc.
+ For Image applications (such as image tagging) we use Convolution Neural Networks (CNN).
+ For sequence data (such as audio in audio to text conversions), we use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).
+ Language conversions (such as English to Chinese) also involve sequential data. Hence, they use complex forms of RNNs.
+ Supervised learning can be done on structured data and unstructured data.
+ Structured data consists of well defined features like number of bedrooms in a flat, square feet etc.
+ Unstructured data consists of inputs such as audio, text or images.
+ Deep learning progress is improved by 2 factors
	+ Increasing the size of the input dataset.
	+ By Increasing the complexity of NN
+ The drawback of using sigmoid function is that points at far left and far right have almost zero slope. This causes gradient descent to work much slower. Hence a ReLU function is used.
